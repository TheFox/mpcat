# MessagePack Cat

Convert [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/)-files to [YAML](http://yaml.org/).

This tool is actually a side product of [One Shall Pass](https://github.com/TheFox/osp).

## Project Outlines

The project outlines as described in my blog post about [Open Source Software Collaboration](https://blog.fox21.at/2019/02/21/open-source-software-collaboration.html).

- The main purpose of this software is to convert and print MessagePack'ed files to a human-readable format. The default format is YAML.
- This list is open. Feel free to request features.
